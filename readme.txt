Restrict permissions with Simple Client Dashboard. Our new "Admin" user role between Administrator and Editor is perfect for clients and Webmasters. 

== Description ==

Simple Client Dashboard offers a new "Admin" user role, which fits perfectly between the default WordPress roles for Administrator and Editor access. This allows clients and Webmasters to manage their website content without you having to worry about critical settings or information being removed or adjusted. 

* Preserve your hard work
* Avoid unexpected messes and troubleshooting sessions
* One-click access restriction

== Incorporate Into Your Clients Site with Ease  ==

If you'd like to adjust the "Admin" role, the free plugin offers a clean and tidy interface so that you can make adjustments. And, [Simple Client Dashboard Pro](https://simpleclientdashboard.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=readme), lets you further customize permissions for more advanced third party plugins.

**Simple Client Dashboard creates a new user role named "Admin"** which is similar to the default "Administrator" role, but with the following changes:

== Hides Non-essential and Troublesome WordPress Dashboard Items ==

* Hide the WordPress Settings menu
* Hide the WordPress Plugins menu
* Hide the WordPress Tools menu
* Hide the WordPress Users menu
* Hide the WordPress Appearance > Editor tab
* Disable the theme installation button

(More options in [Simple Client Dashboard Pro](https://simpleclientdashboard.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=readme))

== Simple Client Dashboard PRO also provides Third Party Plugin Constraints ==

Upgrade to [Simple Client Dashboard Pro](https://simpleclientdashboard.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=readme) to get even more control over how the Admin role can interact with popular third party plugins.

Other user role solutions expect you to enter raw code names for permissions or are limited to capabilities that WordPress exposes by default. While Simple Client Dashboard takes it a step further by custom coding beyond standard WordPress permissions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Could I just use a role editing plugin to do the same thing as Simple Client Dashboard? =

Yes, although this approach takes quite a bit of setup that you have to do on every customer’s website. Simple Client Dashboard offers a swift one-click solution so you can switch all your clients over quickly and easily incorporate it into your new client workflow. And in addition, most of these plugins are limited to user capabilities, while Simple Client Dashboard also provides additional capabilities and permissions that aren’t exposed by WordPress by default.

= Will my clients know they’re not full administrators? =

Probably not; they should still be able to perform most of the tasks they’re interested in, like adding content and managing most website functionality. They would also see their User Role set to “Admin”, which in our experience, satisfies even the most controlling clients. We suggest adding something in your project maintenance contracts that suggests that your agency is set as the “Super-Admin,” and that would be the only ones who can make dramatic or fundamental changes to their sites, such as changing themes and installing plugins.

= I have a question or need help with the plugin, how do I contact your support team? =

To contact our support team, submit your message through our [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/webmaster-user-role/#new-topic-0). Or, you can also submit your message through our website's [Contact page](https://simpleclientdashboard.com/contact-us/).

We also have a [Pro version](https://simpleclientdashboard.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=readme) that offers advanced customization for the Admin role including support for popular third party plugins.
